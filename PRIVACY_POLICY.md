Welcome to the BW: Minimal Activity Tracker!

This is an open source android apps developed by Tan Jun Yan. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the application is also available on google play store.

As an avid google play store user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

Therefore, I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you were stored in your local storage in your phone and it can be simply erased by clearing the application data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely, Tan Jun Yan. Selangor, Malaysia. tjyn0212@gmail.com.
Thanks.
